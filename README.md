The document you've shared outlines the requirements and tasks for defining the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a portfolio project. Here's a breakdown of the tasks you need to complete for your project:

Share your MVP specification:

You need to create a new Google Document to outline your MVP specification and share the link to it.
Rename the document:

After creating the document, you should rename it to the project's name and append "MVP specification" to the title.
Architecture:

In a section named "Architecture," you need to include an illustration or diagram of your Portfolio Project's MVP. This diagram should provide an end-to-end map of how data flows through your system, with clear labels for each component.
APIs:

In a section called "APIs and Methods," you should list and describe the API routes that your web client will use to communicate with your web server. This includes the HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) and the purpose of each API route.
Additionally, you should list and describe any API endpoints or function/methods that will allow other clients to interact with your project.
If you plan to use any 3rd party APIs in your project, you should provide information about those APIs.
Data Modeling:

In a section named "Data Model," create a data model diagram that clarifies how data will be stored in your project. You can use tools like SqlDBM for this purpose.
User Stories:

Define 3-5 detailed user stories that will be satisfied when your MVP is complete. Ensure that these user stories are specific and clear.
Mockups:

Include mockups of each view that will be created for your MVP. If your project has a visual interface, this section is required.
Each of these tasks is crucial for defining and planning your project's MVP, which will serve as the foundation for your project's development. Be sure to provide detailed and clear information in the document you create, as it will help guide your project's development and ensure that you meet your objectives.

If you have specific questions or need further assistance with any of these tasks, feel free to ask.
